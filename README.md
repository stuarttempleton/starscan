# Starscan
Starscan is a procedurally generated adventure game, inspired by classic retro-games like [Nethack](https://www.nethack.org/), [Starflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starflight), and [Star Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control). You play as the captain of the Deep Space Colony Vessel Starscan, exploring procedurally generated sector space to search for the remnants of ancient civilizations and find clues to understand the coming Great Filter. 

It was created as part of a [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com/), and has been tweaked and fleshed out since.

# Install
You can download Starscan as a pre-built binary from [voltur.itch.io](https://voltur.itch.io/starscan) for free. You can choose to donate if you like, but it is not required or expected.

You can also build it from source by cloning or downloading this git repository. You're absolutely welcome to do so.

# Building and Tools
Starscan is created in Godot 3.4. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a FOSS game engine and you can get it from itch.io, steam, or their website. 

I deploy Starscan builds to itch.io periodically using [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/), a tool that takes the guesswork out of creating and managing patches and versions. It's pretty cool.

If you're building for Windows, you might need to follow the instructions for installing [rcedit-x64](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/changing_application_icon_for_windows.html) to get the build application icons to work properly. That isn't required though.

# Contributing
If I'm being completely honest, I haven't really thought this part through very much. I will happily review pull requests and would love to have other folk contribute features. If there's enough interest, I might make some kind of plugin system for it.
